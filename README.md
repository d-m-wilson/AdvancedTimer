AdvancedTimer v1.0.2.0 alpha
=============

AdvancedTimer implementation for Xamarin.Forms

Warning: This is an unstable, alpha-quality version which has not been tested AT ALL.. yet. I will be testing it in the near future as I use it in a Xamarin.Forms app, currently in development.

## AdvancedTimer
Timer object and its methods are implemented for extended support for timers.
You can start, stop, change interval of a timer.
For Xamarin.Forms projects
Can be used with Dependency service.

#### Setup
* Not available on NuGet yet; I don't have a Mac with which to build the iOS project.
* In your .NET Standard 2.0 project, add a reference to AdvancedTimer.Forms.Plugin.Abstractions.dll
* In your Android project, add a reference to AdvancedTimer.Forms.Plugin.Android.dll
* In your iOS project, add a reference to AdvancedTimer.Forms.Plugin.Android.dll

In your iOS and Android projects please call:

iOS
```
AdvancedTimer.Forms.Plugin.iOS.AdvancedTimerImplementation.Init();
```

Android
```
AdvancedTimer.Forms.Plugin.Droid.AdvancedTimerImplementation.Init();
```

You must do this AFTER you call Xamarin.Forms.Init();


#### API Usage

To gain access to the Timer class simply use the dependency service:

```
IAdvancedTimer timer = DependencyService.Get<IAdvancedTimer>();
```

You MUST call initTimer for timer initialization;

```
timer.initTimer(3000, timerElapsed, true);
```
initTimer(interval, Eventhandler function, AutoReset);
                
                
#### Methods

```
timer.startTimer();
```
```
timer.stopTimer();
```
```
timer.getInterval()
```
```
timer.setInterval(5000);
```
```
timer.isTimerEnabled();
```

#### Release Notes
